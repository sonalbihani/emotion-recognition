# Emotion Recognition using Eigen Faces

Keywords: Facial expression recognition; Fisher faces;Principal Component
Analysis; Eigenfaces; Euclidean Distance

This project aims to predict the emotions of the person by his/her facial
expression and swap the appropriate emoticon in place of the face. There are
seven types of human emotions shown, that are universally recognised across
different cultures namely anger, happiness, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise and
contempt.

Most applications of emotion recognition examine static images of facial
expressions. We investigate the application of Fisher face classifiers to emotion
recognition in real time with a video input stream.
The dataset used for the project is CK/CK+ dataset.
The Cohn-Kanade AU-Coded Facial Expression Database is for research in
automatic facial image analysis and synthesis and for perceptual studies.
The dataset contains pictures and their labels, the pictures are 48x48 pixels in
dimension and in greyscale. It includes thousands of images for each emotion
of different people from different geographical areas, age groups and gender to
provide a wide range of face shapes.
The labels describe the picture and the neural network trains over it.
